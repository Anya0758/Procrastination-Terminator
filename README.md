Procrastination Terminator: Gacha Your Way to Productivity!

Procrastination Terminator is an interactive Python mini-game designed for students and productivity seekers who struggle with staying focused. The game uses a gacha (random draw) system where players pull activity cards ranging from study sessions to quick exercises—and even entertainment breaks. Smart probability adjustments encourage more productive choices over time without completely removing fun. As you progress by drawing and completing cards, your score increases until you hit your daily goal. With its simple interface and rewarding feedback loop, it’s a lighthearted tool to gamify your daily routine and build better habits one draw at a time!
